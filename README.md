### Hi there, I am Viraj! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer at Walmart Inc. working on a fraud detection engine preventing fraud worth $100M every year. On the side, I recently created a custom new tab page Chrome extension which eases the process of filtering search results from frequently used target websites called [Bifrost](https://bifrost.virajmavani.com/). When I am not working, you will find me playing open-world or stealth games on my console. I am open to new and exciting career opportunities.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a social platform for academic research in AI
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React.js and Java Spring
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the social platform project mentioned above (email me for more details)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: viraj.mavani1996@gmail.com
