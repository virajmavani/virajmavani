### Hi there, I am Viraj! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer at Amazon Web Services working in fraud and abuse prevention. On the side, I recently created a custom new tab page Chrome extension which eases the process of filtering search results from frequently used target websites called [Bifrost](https://bifrost.virajmavani.com/). When I am not working, you will find me playing open-world or stealth games on my console. I am open to new and exciting career opportunities.
